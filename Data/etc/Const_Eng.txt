Article 2   Belgium comprises three Communities: the Fl emish Community, the French Com munity and the German -speaking Community.   Article 3   Belgium comprises three Regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Re-gion and the Brussels Region.   Article 4   Belgium comprises four linguistic regions: the Dutch -speaking region, the Frenc h-speaking region, the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital and the Ger-man -speaking region.  Each municipality of the Kingdom forms part of one of these linguistic re-gions.  The boundaries of the four linguistic regions can only be changed or cor-rected by a law passed by a majority of the votes cast in each linguistic group in each House, on condition that a majority of the members of each group is present and provided that the total number of votes in favour that are cast in the two linguistic groups is eq ual to at least two thirds of the votes cast.      6 Article 5   The Flemish Region comprises the following provinces:  Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, West Flanders, East Flanders and Limburg.  The Walloon Region comprises the following provinces: Walloon Brabant, Hai naut, Liege, Luxem-bourg and Namur.  A law can exclude certain territories, of which it establishes the bounda-ries, from division into provinces, bring them directly under the federal exec-utive power and subject them to a specific statute. This law must be passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.   Article 6   Provincial subdivisions can only be established by the law.   Article 7   The boundaries of the State, the provinces and the municipalities can only be changed or corrected by virtue of a law.    TITLE I BIS  ON GENERAL P OLITICAL OBJECTIVES OF FEDERAL BELGIUM , THE COMMUNITIES AND THE REGIONS    Article 7 bis  In the exercise of their respective competences, the Federal State, the Communities and the Regions pursue the objectives of sustainable develop-ment in its social, economic and environmental aspects, taking into account the solidarity between the generatio ns.       7 TITLE II   ON BELGIANS AND THEIR RI GHTS    Article 8   The status as a Belgian citizen is acquired,  kept and lost according to rules established by civil law.  The Constitution and the other laws concerning political rights, establish, apart from this status, the necessary conditions for the exercising of these rights.  In a departure from the second paragraph, the law can, in accordance with Belgium’s internatio nal and supranational obligations, establish a right to vote for citizens of the European Union who are not Belgian citizens.  The right to vote referred to in the preceding paragraph can be extended by a law to Belgian residents who are not citizens of a Member State of the European Union, under the conditions and in accordance with the terms specified in such a law.   Transitional provision   The law referred to in the fourth paragraph cannot be passed before 1  January 2001.   Article 9   Naturalisation is granted by the federal legislative power.   Article 10   No class distinctions exist in the State.  Belgians are equal before the law; they alone are eligible for civil and mil-itary service, but for the exceptions that can be created by a law for particular cases.  Equality between women and men is guaranteed.      8 Article 11   Enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised for Belgians must be provided without discrimination.  To this end, laws and federate laws guaran-tee among others the righ ts and freedoms of ideological and philosophical minorities.   Article 11 bis  The law, federate law or rule referred to in Article 134 guarantees that women and men may equally exercise their rights and freedoms, and in par-ticular promotes their equal access to elective and public mandates.  The Council of Ministers and the Governme nts of the Communities and the Regions include both women and men.  The law, federate law or rule referred to in Article 134 provides for women and men to sit on the permanent deputations of the provincial councils, the colleges of the bur gomasters and al dermen, the councils and permanent committees of the public centres for social welfare and on the executives of any other inter -provincial, supra -municipal, inter -municipal or intra -munici-pal territorial body.  The preceding paragraph does not apply when t he law, federate law or rule referred to in Article 134 provides for the direct election of the members of the permanent deputations of the provincial councils, of aldermen, of the members of the councils and permanent committees of the social welfare cent res or of the members of the execu tives of any other inter -provincial, su-pra-municipal, inter -municipal or intra -municipal territorial body.   Article 12   The freedom of the individual is guaranteed.  No one can be prosecuted except in the cases provided  for by the law, and in the form prescribed by the law.  Except in the case of a flagrant offence, no one can be arrested except on the strength of a reasoned judge’s order, which must be served at the latest within forty -eight hours from the deprivation o f liberty and which may only result in provisional detention.      9 Article 13   No one can be separated, against his will, from the judge that the law has assigned to him.   Article 14   No punishment can be introduced or administered except by virtue of the law.   Article 14 bis  Capital punishment is abolished.   Article 15   One’s home is inviolable; no house search may take place except in the cases provided for by the law and in the fo rm prescribed by the law.   Article 16   No one can be deprived of his property except in the case of expropriation for a public purpose, in the cases and manner established by the law and in return for fair compensation paid beforehand.   Article 17   Assets may not be confiscated as a means of punishment.   Article 18   Civil death is abolished; it cannot be re -introduced.   Article 19   Freedom of worship, its public practice and freedom to demonstrate one’s opinions on all matters are guaranteed, but offences committed when this freedom is used may be punished.    10 Article 20   No one can be obliged to contribute in any way whatsoever to t he acts and ceremonies of a religion or to observe its days of rest.   Article 21   The State does not have the right to intervene either in the appointment or in the installation of ministers of any religion whatsoever or to forbid these ministers from corresponding with their superiors, from publishing the acts of these superiors, but, in this latter case, normal responsibilities as regards the press and publishing apply.  A civil wedding should always precede the blessing of the marriage, apart from the exceptions to be established by the law if needed.   Article 22   Everyone has the r ight to the respect of his private and family life, except in the cases and conditions determined by the law.  The laws, federate laws and rules referred to in Article 134 guarantee the protec tion of this right.   Article 22 bis   Each child is entitled to  have his or her moral, physical, mental and sexual integrity respected.  Each child has the right to express his or her views in all matters affecting him or her, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with his or her age and maturity .  Each child has the right to benefit from measures and facilities which pro-mote his or her development.  In all decisions concerning children, the interest of the child is a primary consideration.  The law, federate law or rule referred to in  Article 134  ensures these rights of the child.      11 Article 22 ter   Every person with a disability has the right to full inclusion in society, in-cluding the right to reasonable accommodation.  The law, federate law or rule referred to in Article 134 guarantees the pro-tection of this right.   Article 23   Everyone has the right to lead a life in keeping with human dignity.  To this end, the laws, federate laws and rules referred to in Article 134 guarantee economic, social and cultural rights, taking into account corre-sponding obligations, and determine the conditions for exercising them.  These rights include among others:  1° the right to employment and to the free choice of an occupation within the context of a general employment policy, aimed among oth-ers at ensurin g a level of employment that is as stable and high as possible, the right to fair terms of employment and to fair remunera-tion, as well as the right to information, consultation and collective negotiation;  2° the right to social security, to health care a nd to social, medical and legal aid;  3° the right to decent accommodation;  4° the right to the protection of a healthy environment;  5° the right to cultural and social fulfilment;  6° the right to family allowances.   Article 24   § 1. Education is free; any preventive measure is forbidden; the punish-ment of offences is regulated only by the law or federate law.  The community offers free choice to parents.  The community organises non -denominational education.  This implies in parti cular the respect of the philosophical, ideological or religious beliefs of parents and pupils.  Schools run by the public authorities offer, until the end of compulsory education, the choice between the teaching of one of the recognised reli-gions and non -denominational ethics teaching.    12 § 2. If a community, in its capacity as an organising authority, wishes to delegate powers to one or several autonomous bodies, it can only do so by federate law adopted by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast.   § 3. E veryone has the right to education with the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. Access to education is free until the end of compulsory education.  All pupils of school age have the right to moral or religious education at the community’s expense.   § 4. All pupils or students, parents, teaching staff or institutions are equal before the law or federate law.  The law and federate law take into account objective differences, in particular the characteristics of each organising au-thority that warrant a ppropriate treatment.   § 5. The organisation, the recognition and the subsidising of education by the community are regulated by the law or federate law.   Article 25   The press is free; censorship can never be introduced; no security can be demanded from authors, publishers or printers.  When the author is known and resident in Belgium, neither the publisher, the printer nor the distributor can be prosecuted.   Article 26   Belgians have the right to gather peaceably and without arms, in accord-ance with the laws that can regulate the exercise of this right, without sub-mitting it to prior authorisation.  This provision does not apply to open air meetings, which are entirely subject to police regulations.   Article 27   Belgians have the right to enter into association or partnership; this right cannot be subject to any preventive measure.    13 Article 28   Everyone has the right to address petitions signed by one or more persons to the public authorities.  Constituted bodies are alone entitled to address petitions under a collec-tive name.   Article 29   The confidentiality of letters is inviolable.  The law determines which officials may violate the confidentiality of let-ters entrusted to the postal service.   Article 30   The use of languages spoken in Belgium is optional; only the law can rule on this matter, and only for acts of the public authorities and for judicial af-fairs.   Article 31   No authorisation is necessary prior to taking legal action against civil servants for offences resulting from their administration, except with regard to what has been ruled on concerning ministers and members of the Com-munity and Regional Governments.   Article 32   Everyone has the right to consult any administrative document and to ob-tain a copy, except in the cases and conditions stipulated by the laws, feder-ate laws or rules referred to in Article 134.       14 TITLE III   ON POWERS    Article 33   All powers emanate from the Nation.  These powers are exercised in the manner laid down by the Constitution.   Article 34   The exercising of specific powers can be assigned by a treaty or by a law to institutions of public intern ational law.   Article 35   The federal authority only has competences in the matters that are for-mally assigned to it by the Constitution and the laws passed by virtue of the Constitution itself.  The Communities and the Regions, each in its own field of concern, have competences for the other matters, under the conditions and in the terms stipulated by the law.  This law must be adopted by a majority as described  in Article 4, last paragraph.   Transitional provision   The law referred to in the second par agraph determines the date on which this article comes into force.  This date cannot precede the date of the entry into force of the new article to be inserted in Title III of the Constitution,  which determines the competences exclusive to the federal autho rity.   Article 36   The federal legislative power is exercised jointly by the King, the House of Repre sentatives and the Senate.      15 Article 37   The federal executive power, as regulated by the Constitution, belongs to the King.   Article 38   Each Community has those powers which are recognised by the Consti-tution or by the laws passed by virtue of the Constitution.   Article 39   The law assigns to the regional bodies that it creates and that are com-posed of elected representatives the power to manage the matters that it de-termines, with the exception of those referred to in Articles 30 and 127 to 129, within the scope and according to the manner laid down by a law.  This law must be passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragrap h.   Article 39 bis   Except for matters relating to finances or budget or matters that are reg-ulated by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, matters attributed exclu-sively to regional bodies can be the subject of a referendum in the Region concerned .  The rule referred to in Article 134 determines the procedures and arrange-ments for the referendum, and is adopted by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, under the condition that the majority of the members of the Par-liament concerned is present.  A law passed by a majority as described in Ar-ticle 4, last paragraph lays down additional majority requirements with re-spect to the Brussels -Capital Region.   Article 39 ter   The law, federate law or rule referred to in Article 134 that regulates the elections for the House of Representatives or a Community or Regional Par-liament, and that is promulgated less than one year before the date on which the legislative term is to come to an end, comes into force no sooner than one year after it has been prom ulgated.    16 Transitional provision   This article comes into force on the day when the first elections for the European Parliament take place after it has been published in the Belgian Official Gazette .   Article 40   Judiciary power is exercised by the cou rts.  Court decisions are executed in the name of the King.   Article 41   Interests which are exclusively of a municipal or provincial nature are ruled on by municipal or provincial councils, according to the principles laid down by the Constitution. However, the rule referred to in Article 134 can abolish the provincial institu tions in implementation of a law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph. In such a case, the rule re-ferred to in Article 134 can replace them by supra -municipal collectivities, the councils of which rule the exclusively supra -munici pal interests in ac cord-ance with the principles established by the Constitution. The rule referred to in Article 134 must be adopted by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, under the condition that the majority of the members of the Parliament con-cerned is present.  The rule referred to in Article 134 defines the competences, working rules and mode of election of intra -municipal territorial bodies that are authorised to regulate matters of municipal interest.  These intra -municipal territorial bodie s are created in municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants following the initiative of the municipal coun-cil. Their members are directly elected. In implementation of a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, the federa te law or rule referred to in Article 134 regulates the other conditions and the way in which such intra -municipal territorial bodies may be created.  This federate law and the rule referred to in Article 134 can only be adopted by a majority of two thirds  of the votes cast, under the condition that the majority of the members of the Parliament concerned is present.  Matters of municipal, supra -municipal or provincial interest can be the subject of a referendum in the municipality, supra -municipal collectiv ity or  17 province concerned. The rule referred to in Article 134 regulates the proce-dures and arrangements for the referendum.    CHAPTER I   ON THE FEDERAL HOUSES    Article 42   The members of the two Houses represent the Nation, and not only those who elected them.   Article 43   § 1. For cases determined by the Constitution, the elected members of the House of Representatives are divided into a Dutch linguistic group and a Frenc h linguistic group, in the manner determined by the law.   § 2. For cases determined by the Constitution,  senators,  except the sena-tor appointed by the Parliament of the German -speaking Community, are di-vided into a Dutch linguistic group and a French ling uistic group.  The senators referred to in Article 67, §  1, 1° and 6° make up the Dutch linguistic group of the Senate.  The senators referred to in Article 67, §  1, 2° to 4° and 7° make up the French linguistic group of the Senate.   Transitional provision   This article comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014.  The following provisions apply until that day:   “§ 1. For cases determined by the Constitution, the elected members of each House are divided into a Dutch linguistic group and a French linguistic group, in the manner determined by the law.    18 § 2. The senators referred to in Article 67, §  1, 1°, 3° and 6° m ake up the Dutch linguistic group of the Senate.  The senators referred to in Article 67, §  1, 2°, 4° and 7° make up the French linguistic group of the Senate.”.   Article 44   The Houses meet by right each year on the second Tuesday of October, unless they  have been convened prior to this by the King.  The Houses must meet for at least forty days  each year. The Senate is a non -permanent body.  The King pronounces the closing of the session.  The King has the right to convene the Houses to an extraordinary m eet-ing.   Transitional provision   The second sentence of the second paragraph comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Re gional Parliaments in 2014.   Article 45   The King can adjourn the Houses. However, the adjournment cannot be for longer than one month, nor can it be repeated in the same session with-out the consent of the Houses.   Article 46   The King has the right to dissolve the House of Representatives only  if the latter, with the absolute majority of its members:  1° either rejects a motion of confidence in the Federal Government and does not propose to the King, within three days of the day of the re-jection of the motion, the appointment of a successor to the prime minister;  2° or adopts a motion of no confidence with regard to the Federal Gov-ernment and does not simultaneously propose to the King the ap-pointment of a successor to the prime minister.  The motions of confidence and no confidence can only be  voted on forty - 19 eight hours after the tabling of the motion.  Moreover, the King may, in the event of the resignation of the Federal Gov-ernment, dissolve the House of Representatives after having received its agreement expressed by the absolute majority of  its members.  The act of dissolution convenes the electorate within forty days and the House of Representatives within two months.  In case both Houses are dissolved in accordance with Article 195, the Houses are convened within three months.  In case of early dissolution, the new federal parliamentary term may not extend beyond the day when the first election of the European Parliament following this dis solution is held.   Transitional provision   After the 2014 election of the European Parliament, a law , passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, fixes the date when the sixth paragraph comes into force.  This date is that on which Article 65, third paragraph and Article 118, § 2, fourth sub -paragraph come into force.  The fourth and fifth paragraphs come into force on the day when elec-tions take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014. Until this date, the following provisions are ap-plicable in lieu of the fourth and fifth paragraphs :  “The dissolution of the House of Representatives entails the dissolution of the Senate.  The act of dissolution convenes the electorate within forty days and the Houses within two months.  The dissolution of the House of Representatives leading to parli amentary elections at federal level that take place the same day as the 2014 election of the Community and Regional Parliaments entails the dissolution of the Sen-ate.  The electorate for the House of Representatives is convened within forty days. The Houses  are convened within three months.”.   Article 47   The sittings of the Houses are public.  Nevertheless, each House can meet in camera at the request of its presi-dent or of ten members.   20 It decides afterwards, by absolute majority, whether the sitting must be continued in public on the same subject.   Article 48   Each House verifies the credentials of its members and judges any dispute that can be raised on this matter.   Article 49   One  cannot be a member of both Houses at the same time.   Article 50   Any member of either House appointed by the King as minister and who accepts this appointment ceases to sit in Parliament and takes up his man-date again when the King has terminated his off ice as minister.  The law de-termines the rules for his replacement in the House concerned.   Article 51   Any member of either House appointed by the Federal Government to any salaried position other than that of minister and who accepts the appoint-ment immediately ceases to sit in Parliament and only takes his seat again after having been re -elected.   Articl e 52   Each session, each House appoints its president, its vice -presidents, and forms its bureau.   Article 53   All resolutions are passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, ex-cept for what is established by the rules of procedure of the Houses wi th re-gard to elections and nominations.  If the vote is tied, the proposal submitted for discussion is rejected.  Neither of the two Houses can pass a resolution unless a majority of its  21 members is present.   Article 54   Except for budgets and laws requiring a special majority, a reasoned mo-tion signed by at least three -quarters of the members of one of the linguistic groups and tabled following the depositing of the report and prior to the final vote in a public sitting c an declare that the provisions that it designates of a Government bill or private member’s bill can gravely damage relations be-tween the Communities.  In this case, Parliamentary procedure is suspended and the motion is re-ferred to the Council of Ministers , which within thirty days gives its reasoned opinion on the motion and invites the House involved to pronounce on this opinion or on the Government bill or private member’s bill that, if need be, has been amended.  This procedure can be applied only once by the members of a linguistic group with regard to the same Government bill or private member’s bill.   Article 55   Votes are cast by sitting and standing or by call -ove r; on the laws as a whole is al ways voted by call -over.  The election and nomination o f candi-dates are carried out by secret ballot.   Article 56   The House of Representatives has the right to hold an enquiry.  At the request of fifteen of its members, the House of Representatives, a  Com munity or Regional Parliament or the King, the Senate  can decide by ab-solute majority of the votes cast, with at least a third of the votes cast in each linguistic group, that an information report will be drafted concerning an is-sue that also has repercussions on the competences of the Communities or Region s. The report is approved by absolute majority of the votes cast, with at least a third of the votes cast in each linguistic group.   Transitional provision   This article comes into force on the day when elections take place with a  22 view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014. Until this day, th e following provision applies:   “Each House has the right to hold an enquiry.”.   Article 57   It is forbidden to present petitions to the Houses in person.  The House of Represent atives has the right to send to ministers petitions that are addressed to it.  The ministers are obliged to give explanations on the content of these petitions whenever the House so requires.   Transitional provision   The second paragraph comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014. Until this day, the following provision applies in lieu of the second paragraph:   “Each House has the right to send to ministers pet itions that are ad-dressed to it. The ministers are obliged to explain the content of these peti-tions wh enever the House so requires.”.   Article 58   No member of either House can be prosecuted or be the subject of any investigation with regard to opinions expressed and votes cast by him in the exercise of his duties.   Article 59   Except in the case of a flagrant offence, no member of either House may, during a session and in criminal matters, be directly referred or summoned before a court or be arrested,  except with the authorisation of the House of which he is a member.  Except in the case of a flagrant offence, coercive measures requiring the intervention of a judge cannot, during a session and in criminal matters, be instituted against a member of eith er House, except by the first President of  23 the appeal court at the request of the competent judge.  This decision is to be communicated to the President of the House concerned.  All searches or seizures executed by virtue of the  preceding paragraph can be p erformed only in the presence of the President of the House con-cerned or a member appointed by him.  During the session, only the officers of the public prosecutor’s office and competent officers may institute criminal proceedings against a member of eithe r House.  The member concerned of either House may at any stage of the judicial enquiry request during a session and in criminal matters that the House of which he is a member suspend proceedings.  To grant this request, the House concerned must decide by a  majority of two thirds of the votes cast.  Detention of a member of either House or his pr osecution before a court is sus pended during the session if the House of which he is a member so re-quests.   Article 60   Each House determines, in its rules of procedure, the way in which it ex-ercises its duties.    SECTION I   ON THE HOUSE O F REPRESENTATIVES    Article 61   The members of the House of Representatives are elected directly by cit-izens who are at least eighteen years of age and who do not fall within the categories of exclusion stipulated by the law.  Each elector has the right to only one vote.   Article 62   The composition of the electoral colleges is regulated by the law.   24 Elections take place in accordance with the system of proportional repre-sentation that the law determines.  Voting is obligatory and secret. It takes place in the municipality, except in the cases determined by the law.   Article 63   § 1. The House of Representatives is composed of one hundred and fifty members.   § 2. The number of seats in each electoral district corresponds to the re-sult of dividing the number of inhabitants of the elect oral district by the fed-eral divisor, which is obtained by dividing the number of the population of the Kingdom by one hundred and fifty.  The remaining seats are assigned to the electoral districts with the great-est surplus of population not yet represent ed.   § 3.  The distribution of the members of the House of Representatives among the electoral districts is determined by the King in proportion to the population.  The number of inhabitants in each electoral district is established every ten years by a census or by any other means defined by the law.  The King publishes the results within six months.  Within three months of this publication, the King determines the number of seats to be assigned to each electoral district.  The new distribution is applied as of the following general election.   § 4. The law determines the electoral districts; it also determines the con-ditions required to be an elector as well as the way in which elections are conducted.  However, the law dete rmines special rules with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of French and Dutch -speaking people in the former prov-ince of Brabant.  The provisions which establish these special rules may only be amended by a law passed by a majority as describe d in Article 4, last paragraph.      25 Article 64   To be eligible, one must:  1° be Belgian;  2° enjoy civil and political rights;  3° have reached the age of eighteen;  4° be resident in Belgium.  No other condition of eligibility can be required.   Transitional provision   The first paragraph, 3° comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014. Until this day, and without prejudice to Article 64, 1°, 2° and 4°, one must have reached t he age of twenty -one.   Article 65   The members of the House of Representatives are elected for five years.  The House is re -elected as a whole every five years.  Elections for the House take place on the same day as elections for the European Parliament.   Transitional provision   After elections for the European Parliament have been held in 2014, a law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph sets the date on which the third paragraph comes into force.  This date is that on which Arti cle 46, sixth paragraph and Article 118, § 2, fourth sub -paragraph come into force.  Parliamentary elections at federal level will in any case take place on the same day as the first elections for the European Parliament following the publication of this r evision in the Belgian Official Gazette .   Article 66   Each member of the House of Representatives has an annual indemnity of twelve thousand francs.   26 Within the national borders, the members of the House of Representa-tives have the right to free travel o n all means of transport operated or con-ceded by the public authorities.  The President of the House of Representatives can be granted an annual indemnity to be charged to the allowance that covers the expenses of this assembly.

From the death of the King until the oath is sworn by his successor to the  40 throne or by the Regent, the King’s constitutional powers are  exercised, in the name of the Belgian people, by the ministers meeting in council, and un-der their responsibility.   Article 91   The King attains his majority upon his eighteenth birthday.  The King only accedes to the throne after having sworn the follo wing oath before the united Houses:  “I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to preserve the country’s national independence and its territorial integrity .”.   Article 92   If upon the death of the King, his successor is a minor, the two Houses meet as a single assembly to appoint a Regent and a Guardian.   Article 93   If the King finds himself unable to reign, the ministers, having had this in-ability stated, immediately con vene the Houses.  The Regent and Guardian are appointed by the joint Houses.   Article 94   Only one person may be Regent.  The Regent takes up office only after having sworn the oath as prescribed in Article 91.

Article 102   In no circumstances may a written or oral order of the King exempt a min-ister from his accountabili ty.   Article 103   Ministers are tried exclusively by the appeal court for offences they have allegedly committed in the exercise of their duties.  The same rule applies in the case of offences allegedly committed by ministers outside the exercise of their  duties and for which they are tried during the exercise of their duties.  As the case may be, Articles 59 and 120 are not applicable.  The law determines the manner of proceeding against them, both when they are prosecuted and when they are tried.  The law  designates the appeal court having jurisdiction , which sits in banc, and speci fies its composition.  The judgments of the appeal court can be appealed to the united chambers of the Supreme Court, which does not pronounce on the merits of the case.  Only th e public prosecutor to the appeal court that has jurisdiction may  43 institute and lead criminal proceedings against a minister.  Authorisation by the House of Representatives is required for any public prosecutor’s request to refer the minister concerned to a particular court or to discharge him, for his direct summons before the appeal court and, except in a case of a flagrant offence, for his arrest.  The law determines the procedure to be followed when Articles 103 and 125 are both applicable.  A pardon ma y be granted to a minister convicted in accordance with the first paragraph only upon request by the House of Representatives.  The law determines in which cases and in accordance with which rules injured parties may institute a civil action.   Transitional provision   The present article is not applicable to acts which have been the subject of a preliminary judicial investigation or to proceedings instituted prior to the entry into force of the law implementing the article.  In such a case, the following rule applies: the House of Representatives has the right to indict ministers and to bring them before the Supreme Court. Only the united chambers of this court have jurisdiction to try ministers in cases covered by the criminal laws and by applic ation of the penalties pre-scribed by such laws.  The Law of 17 December 1996 concerning the tempo-rary and partial implementation of Article 103 of the Constitution remains applicable in such cases.   Article 104   The King appoints and dismisses the federal  secretaries of State.  These are members of the Federal Government.  They do not form part of the Council of Ministers.  They are deputies to a minister.  The King determines their duties and the limits within which they may re-ceive the right to countersign .  Constitutional provisions that apply to ministers apply equally to federal secretaries of State, with the exception of Articles 90, second paragraph, 93 and 99.       44 SECTION III   ON RESP ONSIBILITIES    Article 105   The King has no powers other than those formally attributed to him by the Constitution and by specific laws passed by virtue of the Constitution it-self.   Article 106   No act of the King can take effect without the countersignature of a min-ister, who, in doing so, assumes responsibility for it.   Article 107   The King bestows ranks within the army.  He appoints civil servants to positions in the general and foreign affairs administrations of the State, but for those exceptions created by the laws.  He makes appointments to other positions only by virtue of specific legal provisions.   Article 108   The King makes decrees and regulations required for the execution of laws, without ever having the power either to suspend the laws themselves or to grant dispensation from their execution.   Article 109   The King sanctions and promulgates laws.   Article 110   The King has the right to remit or to reduce sentences passed by judges, except with regard to what has been ruled on concerning ministers and  45 members of the Community and Regional Governments.   Article 111   The King may not pardon a minist er or a member of a Community or Re-gional Government convicted by the Supreme Court, except at the request of the House of Representatives or of the Parliament concerned.

There is a Parliament of the Flemish Community, called the Flemish Parliament, and a Parliament of the French Community, the composition and functioning of which are determined by a law adopted by a majority as de-scribed in Article 4, last paragraph.  Ther e is a Parliament of the German -speaking Community, the composi-tion and functioning of which are determined by the law.   § 2. Without prejudice to Article 137, the regional bodies referred to in Ar-ticle 39 include a Parliament for each Region.   Article 116   § 1. The Community and Regional Parliaments are composed of elected representatives.   § 2. Each Community Parliament is composed of members elected di-rectly as members of the Community Parliament concerned or as me mbers of a Regional Parliam ent.  Except when  Article 137 is applied, each Regional Parliament is composed of members elected directly as members of the Regional Parliament con-cerned or as mem bers of a Community Parliament.      47 Article 117   Members of the Community and Regional Parliamen ts are elected for a period of five years.  The Community and Regional Parliaments are re -elected as a whole every five years.  Elections for the Community and Regional Parliaments take place on the same day and coincide with elections for the European Parl iament.  In execution of a law as described in Article 118, § 2, fourth sub -para-graph, a federate law or a rule referred to in Article 134, passed in accordance with Article 118, § 2, fourth sub -paragraph, may derogate from the  first and second paragraphs.   Article 118   § 1. Elections referred to in Article 116, § 2, as well as the composition and functioning of Community and Regional Parliaments are regulated by the law. Except for the Parliament of the German -speaking Community, such a law is adopted by a majority as de scribed in Article 4, last paragraph.   § 2. A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph designates those matters relating to the election, composition and function-ing of the Brussels -Capital Region Parliament, the Flemish Communi ty Par-liament, the French Community Parliament and the Walloon Region Parlia-ment which these Parliaments regulate, each for itself, either by federate law or by rule as referred to in Article 134, according to the case.  This federate law and this rule as r eferred to in Article 134 are adopted by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that a majority of the members of the Parliament concerned is present.

This federate law and rule referred to in Article 134 are adopted by majorities as described in the first to third sub -paragraphs.   Transitional provision   After elections for the European Parliament have been held in 2014, a law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph sets the date on which § 2, fourth sub -paragraph, comes into force. This date is that on which Article 46, sixth paragr aph and Article 65, third paragraph come into force.   Article 118 bis  Within the national borders, the members of the Regional and Commu-nity Parliaments, referred to in Articles 2 and 3, have the right to free travel on all means of transport operated or conceded by the public authorities.   Article 119   A member of a Community or Regional Parliament cannot be at the same time a member of the House of Representatives. Moreover, neither can he be a senator as referred to in Article 67, § 1, 6° and 7°.   Transitional provision   This article comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Regional Parliaments in 2014. Until this day, the following provisions apply:   “A member of a Community or Regional Parliament cannot be at the same time a member of the House of Representatives. Moreover, neither can he be a senator as referred to in Articl e 67, § 1, 1°, 2°, 6° and 7°.”.   Article 120   All members of Community and Regional Parliaments benefit f rom the immunities d escribed in Articles 58 and 59.    49 SUB-SECTION  II ON COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL GOVE RNMENT S   Article 121   § 1. There is a Government of the Flemish Community and a Government of the French Community, the composition and functioning of which are de-termined by a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last para-graph.  There is a Government of the German -speaking Community, the compo-sition and functioning of which are determined by the law.   § 2. Without prejudice to Article 137, the regional bodies referred to in Ar-ticle 39 include a Government for each Region.   Article 122   Members of each Community or  Regional Governm ent are elected by their Parlia ment.   Article 123   § 1. The law establishes the composition and functioning of the Commu-nity and Regional Governments. Except with regard to the Government of the German -speaking Community, this law is ado pted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.   § 2. A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph designates those matters relating to the composition and functioning of the Brussels -Capital Region Government, the F lemish Community Government, the French Community Government and the Walloon Region Government which their Parliaments regulate, each one in so far as it is concerned, either by federate law or by rule as referred to in Article 134, according to the case.  This federate law and this rule referred to in Article 134 are adopted by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that a majority of the members of the Parliament concerned is present.  The law as described in the first sub -paragraph determines a dditional  50 majority requirements with respect to the Parliament of the Brussels Capital Region.  A law designates those matters relating to the composition and function-ing of the government of the German -speaking Community w hich the Parlia-ment of this Com munity regulates by federate law. This federate law is adopted by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that a majority of the members of the Parliament is present.   Article 124   No member of a Community or Regional Government can be prosecuted  or be the subject of any investigation with regard to opinions expressed and votes cast by him in the exercise of his duties.   Article 125   Members of a Community or Regional Government are tried exclusively by the appeal court for offences they have allegedly committed in the exer-cise of their duties. The same rule applies in the case of offences allegedly committed by members of a Community or Regional Government outside the exercise of their duties and for which they are tried during the exercise of their duties. As the case may be, Articles 120 and 59 are not applicable.  The law determines the manner of proceeding against them, both when they are prosecuted and when they are tried.  The law designates the appeal court that has jurisdiction, which sits in banc, and specifies its composition.  The judgments of the appeal court can be appealed to the united chambers of the Supreme Court, which does not pronounce on the merits of the case.  Only the public prosecutor to the appeal court having jurisdiction may in-stitute and lead criminal proceedings against a member of a Community or of a Regional Government.  Authorisation by the Parliament of the Community or Region, each one for matters of its concern, is required for any public prosecutor’s request to refer the member concerned to a particular court or to discharge him, for his direct summons before the appe al court and, except in a case of a flagrant offence, for his arrest.  The law determines the procedure to be followed when Articles 103 and 125 are both applicable and when there is a double application of Article 125.   51 A pardon may be granted to a member  of a Community or Regional Gov-ernment convicted in accordance with the first paragraph only upon request by the Community or Regional Parliament concerned.  The law determines in which cases and in accordance with which rules injured parties may bring a c ivil action.  The laws referred to in the present article must be adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.   Transitional provision   The present article is not applicable to acts which have been the subject of a preliminary judicia l investigation or to proceedings instituted prior to the entry into force of the law implementing the article.  In such a case, the following rule applies: the Community or Regional Par-liament concerned has the right to indict members of their Government and to bring them before the Supreme Court. Only the united chambers of this court have jurisdiction to try ministers in cases covered by the criminal laws and by application of the penalties prescribed by such laws.  The special Law of 28 February 1997 con cerning the temporary and partial implementation of Article 125 of the Constitution remains applicable in such cases.   Article 126   Constitutional provisions that apply to members of the Regional and Community Governments, as well as the implementing laws referred to in Ar-ticle 125, last paragraph apply equally to Regional secretaries of State.       52 SECTION II   ON RESP ONSIBILITIES   SUB-SECTION I ON THE RESP ONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMUNITIES    Article 127   § 1. The Parliaments of the Flemish and French Communities, each one in so far as it is conce rned, regulate by federate law:  1° cultural matters;  2° education, with the exception of:  a) the  setting of the beginning and of t he end of compulsory educa-tion;  b) minimum standards for the granting of diplomas;  c) the pension scheme;  3° cooperation between the Communities, as well as international co-operation, including the concluding of treaties for those ma tters re-ferred to in 1° and 2°.  A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph des-ignates the cultural matters referred to in 1° and determines the forms of co-operation referred to in 3°, as well as the specific arrangeme nts for the con-cluding of treaties referred to in 3°.   § 2. These federate laws have the force of law in the Dutch -speaking and French -speaking regions respectively, as well as in those institutions estab-lished in the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital which, because of their ac-tivities, must be considered as belonging exclusively to one Community or the other.   Article 128   § 1. The Parliaments of the Flemish and French Communities regulate by federate law, each one in so far as it is concerned, person -related matters, as  53 well as, in such matters, cooperation between the Communities and interna-tional cooperation, including th e concluding of treaties.  A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph des-ignates such person -related matters and determines the forms of coopera-tion, as well as the specific arrangements for the concluding of treaties.   § 2. These federate laws have the force of law in the Dutch -speaking and French -speaking regions respectively, as well as – unless a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph determines otherwise – with regard to those institutions est ablished in the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital which, because of their organisation, must be considered as belong-ing exclusively to one Community or the other.   Article 129   § 1. The Parliaments of the Flemish and French Communities, to the ex-clusio n of the federal legislator, regulate by federate law, each one as far as it is conce rned, the use of languages for:  1° administrative matters;  2° education in the establishments created, subsidised or recogn ised by the public authorities;  3° social relati ons between employers and their personnel, as well as company acts and documents required  by the law and by regulations.   § 2. These federate laws have the force of law in the Dutch -speaking and French -speaking regions respectively, except as concerns:  — the municipalities or groups of municipalities adjacent to another lin-guistic Region and in which the law prescribes or permits the use of another language than that of the Region in which they are located. For these municipalities, a change to the rules gov erning the use of languages in the matters as described in § 1 may be made only by a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph;  — services whose activities extend beyond the linguistic region within which they are located;  — federal and international institutions designated by the law whose activities are common to more than one Community.      54 Article 130   § 1. The Parliament of the German -speaking Commu nity regulates by fed-erate law:  1° cultural matters;  2° person -related matters;  3° education, within the limits established by Article 127 , § 1, first sub -paragraph, 2°;  4° cooperation between the Communities, as well as international co-operation, including the conclusion of treaties, for matter s referred to in 1°, 2° and 3°;  5° the use of languages for education in establishments created, subsi-dised or recognised by the public authorities.  The law designates the cultural and person -related matters referred to in 1° and 2° and determines the forms of cooperation referred to i n 4°, as well as the manner in which treaties are concluded.   § 2. These federate laws have the force of law in the German -speaking re-gion.   Article 131   The law determines the measures designed to prevent all forms of dis-crimination for ideological or philosophical reasons.   Article 132   The right to propose legislation belongs to the Community Government and to the members of the Community Parliament.   Article 133   Only the federate law can give an authoritative interpretation of federate laws.       55 SUB-SECTION II ON THE COMPETEN CES OF THE REGIONS   Article 134   Laws passed in order to execute Article 39 determine the judicial force of the rules which the bodies that they create enact in matters which they de-termine.  They can confer to these bodies the power to pass federate laws that have the force of law, within the jurisdiction and in the manner that they deter-mine.    SUB-SECTION III SPECIAL PR OVISI ONS   Article 135   A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph des-ignates the authorities which exercise for the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital the competences not assigned to the Communities in the matters re-ferred to in Article 128, § 1.   Article 135 bis   A law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph can attribute to the Region of Brussels -Capital, for the bilingual region of Brus-sels -Capital, powers that have not been assigned to the Communities in the matters referre d to in Article 127, § 1, first sub -paragraph, 1° and in the same sub -paragraph, 3°, insofar as this 3° concerns matters referred to in the afore-said 1°.   Article 136   There are linguistic groups within the Parliament of the Brussels -Capital  56 Region, as w ell as executive colleges, responsible for Community matters; their composition, functioning and competences and, without prejudice to Article 175, their financing are regulated by a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph.  The  colleges together form the United College, which acts as a consulta-tion and coordination body between the two Communities.   Article 137   With a view to the application of Article 39, the Parliaments of the Flemish and French Communities, as well as their respective Governments, may ex-ercise the competences, respectively, of the Flemish Region and of the Wal-loon Region, under the conditions and according to the terms set by the law.  This law must be adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, las t para-graph.   Article 138   The Parliament of the French Community, on one hand, and the Parlia-ment of the Walloon Region and the French linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels -Capital Region, on the other hand, may decide by common accord and each by federate law, that in the French -speaking region, the Par-liament and the Government of the Walloon Region and, in the bilingual re-gion of Brussels -Capital, the French linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels -Capital Region and its executi ve college exercise, in full or in part, competences of the French Community.  These federate laws are adopted by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast within the Parliament of the French Community and by absolute majority of the votes cast within the Pa rliament of the Walloon Region and within the French linguistic group in the Parliament of the Brussels -Capital Region, pro-vided that a majority of the Parliament members or of the members of the linguistic group concerned is present. They can regulate the  financing of the competences which they designate, as well as the transfer of personnel, as-sets, rights and obligations linked with these competences.  These competences are exercised, according to the case, by means of fed-erate laws, decisions or regulat ions.      57 Article 139   Upon proposal by their respective Governments, the Parliament of the German -speaking Community and the Parliament of the Walloon Region can, each by federate law,  decide by common accord that the Parliament and the Government of the G erman -speaking Community exercise, in whole or in part, competences of the Walloon Region.  These competences are exercised, according to the case, by means of fed-erate laws, decisions or regulations.   Article 140   The Parliament and the Government of the  German -speaking Community exercise by means of decisions and regulations all other competences at-tributed to them by the law.  Article 159 is applicable to these decisions and regulations.    CHAPTER V   ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT , AND THE PREVENTION  AND RESOLUTION OF CONFLI CTS  SECTION I   ON THE PREVENTION OF CONFLICTS OF COMPETE NCE   Article 141   The law organises a procedure to prevent conflicts between laws, feder-ate laws and rules referred to in Article 134, as well as between federate laws themselve s and between the rules referred to in Article 134 themselves.       58 SECTION II   ON THE CONSTITUTI ONAL COURT   Article 142   There is for all Belgium a Constitutional Court, the composition, compe-tences and functioning of which are established by the law.  This Court rules by means of judgments on:  1° those conflicts referred to in Article 141;  2° the violation of Articles 10, 11 and 24 by a law, a federate law or a rule as referred to in Article 134;  3° the violation of constitutional articles that the law determines by a law,  a federate law or by a rule as referred to in Article 134.  A matter may be referred to the Court by any authority designated by the law, by any person that can prove an interest or, pre -judicially, by any court.  The Court pronoun ces by a ruling, under the conditions and according to the terms specified by the law, on every referendum described in Article 39 bis before it is organised.  In the cases, under the conditions and according to the terms that it spec-ifies, the law can give  the Court competence to pronounce by a judgment on appeals lodged against decisions made by legislative assemblies or bodies thereof regarding the control of electoral expenditure incurred in the elec-tions for the House of Representatives.  The laws refer red to in the first paragraph, in the second paragraph, 3° and in the third to fifth paragraphs are adopted by a majority as describe d in Article 4, last paragraph.       59 SECTION III   ON THE PREVENTI ON AND THE SETTLEMENT  OF CONFLI CTS OF INTEREST    Article 143   § 1. In the exercise of their respective responsibilities, the federal State, the Communities, the Regions and the Joint Community Commission act with respect for federal loyalty, in order to prevent conflicts of interest.   § 2. The Senate makes decisio ns, by means of reasoned opinions, on con-flicts of interest which may arise between the assemblies which legislate through laws, federate laws or rules as referred to in Article 134, under the conditions and in the manner determined by a law adopted by a m ajority as referred to in Article 4, last paragraph.   § 3. A law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph organises a procedure designed to prevent and to settle conflicts of interest between the Federal Government, the Community an d Regional Govern-ments and the United College of the Joint Community Commission.   § 4. The procedures described in §§ 2 and 3 do not apply to laws, decrees, regulations, acts and decisions of the Federal State relating to the basis of taxation, tax rates and exemptions, and any other element playing a role in the computation of the personal income tax.   Transitional provision   Concerning the prevention and the settlement of conflicts of interest, the ordinary law of 9 August 1980 on institutional reforms remains valid; how-ever, it can only be repealed, completed, corrected or replaced by those laws mentioned in §§ 2 and 3.       60 CHAPTER VI   ON JUDI CIAL P OWER    Article 144   Disputes about civil rights belong exclusively to the competence of the courts.  However, the law can empower the Council of State or federal adminis-trative courts, in accordance with the terms it specifies, to rule on the effects that their decisions have with respect to civil law.   Article 145   Disputes about political rights belon g to the competence of the courts, except for the exceptions established by the law.   Article 146   A court and a body capable of rendering judgment can only be estab-lished by virtue of a law. No extraordinary courts or commissions may be cre-ated, no matte r under which designation.   Article 147   There is a Supreme Court for all Belgium.  This Court has no competence over the substance of the case.   Article 148   Court hearings are public, unless such public access endangers morals or the peace; if such is the case, the Court so declares in a judgment.  In cases of political or press offences, proceedings can only be conducted in camera on the basis of a unanimous vote.      61 Article 149   Each judgment is supported by reasons. It is made public according to the terms specified by the law. In criminal matters, the operative part is pro-nounced publicly.    Article 150   A jury is sworn in for all criminal matters, as well  as for political and press offences, with the exception of press offences motivated by racism or xeno-phobia.   Article 151   § 1. Judges are independent in the exercise of their jurisdictional compe-tences.  The public prosecutor is independent in conducting individual inves-tigations and prosecutions, without prejudice to the right of the competent minister to order prosecutions and to prescribe binding directives on crimi-nal policy, including policy on invest igations and prosecutions.  Moreover, Community and Regional Governments have the right, each one insofar as it is concerned, to order prosecutions regarding matters falling under their responsibility through the Minister referred to in the first para-graph . A law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph determines the manner in which they exercise this right.  A law passed by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph pro-vides for the participation by the Communities and the Regions, in matters falling under their responsibility, in the elaboration of the directives de-scribed in the first sub -paragraph and in planning security policy, and also for the participation of their representatives in the meetings of the College of Pub lic Prosecutors General, insofar as these meetings have reference to these same matters.   § 2. There is one High Council of Justice for all Belgium. In the exercise of its competences, the High Council of Justice respects the independence re-ferred to in §  1.  The High Council of Justice is composed of a Dutch -speaking college and of a French -speaking college. Each college comprises an equal number of members and is constituted with equal representation, on the one hand, of  62 judges and officers of the public  prosecutor’s office elected directly by their peers under the conditions and in the manner determined by the law and, on the other hand, of other members appointed by the Senate by a two -thirds majority of the votes cast, under conditions established by t he law.  Within each college,  there is a nomination and appointment committee,  as well as an advisory and investigatory committee, which are constituted with equal representation in accordance with the provision laid down in the preceding paragraph.  The l aw specifies the composition of the High Council of Justice, of its col-leges and of their committees, as well as the conditions under which and the manner in which they exercise their competences.   § 3. The High Council of Justice exercises its comp etence s in the following areas:  1° the nomination of candidates for appointment as judge, as referred to in §  4, first sub -paragraph or for appointment as officer of the pub-lic prosecutor’s office;  2° the nomination of candidates for an appointment to the positions re-ferred to in § 5, first sub -paragraph and to the position of head of the public prosecutor’s office;  3° access to the position of judge or of officer of the public prosecutor’s office;  4° training of judges and of officers of the public prosecutor’s office;  5° drafting of general profiles for t he positions referred to in 2°;  6° voicing of advice and of proposals concerning the general operation and  organisation of the judiciary;  7° general s urveillance on and the promoting of the us e of means of in-ternal control;  8° to the exclusion of all discipl inary and criminal competences:  – the receiving and the following -up of complaints relating to the operation of the judiciary;  – the conducting of an enquiry on the operation of the judiciary.  Under the conditions and in the manner determined by the law, the com-petences referred to in 1° to 4° are assigned to the relevant nomination and appointment committee, and the competences ref erred to in 5° to 8° are as-signed to the relevant advisory and investigatory committee.  The law deter-mines the cases in which and the manner in which the nomination and ap- 63 pointment committees and the advisory and investigatory committees exer-cise their com petences jointly.  A law to be adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph determines the other competences of this Council.   § 4. The justices of the peace and the judges of the courts and of the Su-preme Court are appointed by the Kin g under the conditions and in the man-ner specified by the law.  Such appointment is made on reasoned nomination by the relevant nom-ination and appointment committee, by a majority of two thirds in accord-ance with the terms specified by the law and after ev aluation of qualifications and aptitude.  The nomination can be rejected only in the manner specified by the law and with justification.  In the case of appointment of an appeal judge or of a judge of the Su-preme Court, the general assembly of the court concerned issues a reasoned opinion in the manner specified by the law, prior to the nomination referred to in the preceding paragraph.   § 5. The first president of the Supreme Court, the first presidents of the appeal courts and the presidents of the lower courts are appointed to those positions by the King under the conditions and in the manner specified by the law.  Such appointment is mad e on reasoned nomination by the relevant nom-ination and appointment committee, by a majority of two thirds in accord-ance with the terms specified by the law and after evaluation of qualifications and aptitude.  The nomination may be rejected only in the man ner specified by the law and with justification.  In the case of appointment to the position of first president of the Su-preme Court or of first president of an appeal court, the general assembly of the court concerned issues a reasoned opinion in the mann er specified by the law, prior to the nomination referred to in the preceding paragraph.  The president of the Supreme Court, the presidents of the sections of this court, the presidents of the divisions of the appeal courts and the vice -presi-dents of the lower courts are appointed to their positions by the courts from their midst under the conditions and in the manner specified by the law.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 152, the law specifies the dura-tion of the appointment to these positions.    64 § 6. In the manner specified by the law, the judges, the incumbents of the positions referred to in § 5, fourth sub -paragraph and the officers of the pub-lic prosecutor’s office are subject to an evaluation.   Transitional  provision   The provisions of §§ 3 to 6 enter into force after the setting up of the High Council of Justice, referred to in § 2.  On that date, it is assumed that the first president and the president of the Supreme Court, the presidents of the sections of this court , the first pres-idents of the appeal courts, the presidents of the divisions of these courts and the presidents and vice -presidents of the lower courts are appointed to these positions for the duration and under the conditions specified by the law and that  they are appointed at the same time to the Supreme Court, to the appeal court or to the labour court and to the corresponding lower court, respec-tively.  In the meantime, the following provisions remain applicable:  The justices of the peace and the judge s of the lower courts are appointed directly by the King.  The judges of the appeal courts and the presidents and vice -presidents of the courts of first instance under their jurisdiction are appointed by the King from two lists each with two candidates,  one submitted by these courts,  the other by the provincial councils and the Parliament of the Brussels -Capital Region, depending upon the case.  The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the King from two lists each with two candidates, one submitted by the Supreme Court, the other alternately by the House of Representatives and by the Senate.  In these two cases, the candidates placed on one list may also appear on the other.  All the nominations are made public at least fifteen days before the ap-poin tment.  The courts choose from among themselves their presidents and vice -presidents.   Article 152   Judges are appointed for life.  They retire at an age determined by the law and receive the pension provided for by the law.   65 No judge can be deprived of his post or suspended except by a court de-cision.  The transfer of a judge can only take place by his appointment to a new position and with his consent.   Article 153   The King appoints and dismisses officials of the public prosecutor’s of-fices attached to the courts.   Article 154   Salaries of members of the judicature are determined by the law.   Article 155   A judge cannot accept a salaried position from a Government,  unless this position is exercised free of charge, and even then, such a position must not entail an incompatibility as determined by the law.   Article 156   There are five appeal courts in Belgium:  1° that of Brussels, with jurisdiction over the provi nces of Flemish Bra-bant, of Wal loon Brabant and the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital;  2° that of Ghent, with jurisdiction over the provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders;  3° that of Antwerp, with jurisdiction over the provinces of Antwerp and Limburg;  4° that of Liege, with jurisdiction over the provinces of Liege, Namur and Luxembourg;  5° that of Mons, with jurisdiction over the province of Hainaut.   Article 157   There are military courts when a state of war referred to in Article 167, § 1, second sub -paragraph has been stated to exist.  The organisation of the military courts, their powers, their members’ rights and obligations as well  66 as their members’ terms of office are determined by the law.  There are commercial courts in the places det ermined by the law. The law lays down rules for their organisation, their powers, the way their members are appointed as well as their members’ terms of office.  The law also lays down rules for the organisation of the labour courts, their powers, the way their members are appointed as well as their members’ terms of office.  There are courts for the enforcement of penalties in the places deter-mined by the law.  The law lays down rules for their organisation, their pow-ers, the way their members are appointed  as well as their members’ terms of office.   Transitional provision   The first paragraph becomes effective on the date of repeal of the Law of 15 June 1899 containing Titles I and II of the Military Penal Procedure Code.  Until then, the following provision remains effective:  Specific laws regulate the organisation of the military courts, their pow-ers, their members’ rights and obligations as well as their members’ terms of office.

CHAPTER VII   ON THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND ADMINISTRAT IVE COURTS    Article 160   There is a Council of State for all Belgium, the composition, competences and functioning of which are determined by the law. However, the law can give the King the power to establish the procedure in accordance with the principles that it determines.

Article 161   An administrative court can only be established by virtue of a law.    68 CHAPTER VIII   ON PR OVIN CIAL AND MUNI CIPAL INSTITUTI ONS   Article 162   Provincial and municipal institutions are regulated by the law.  The law guarantees the application of the following principles:  1° the direct election of the members of provincial and municipal coun-cils;  2° the attribution to provincial and municipal councils of all that is of provincial and municipal interest, without prejudice to the approval of their acts in the cases and in the manner that the law determines;  3° the decentralisation of competences to pro vincial and municipal in-stitutions;  4° the public nature of provincial and municipal council meetings, within the limits established by the law;  5° the disclosure of accounts and budgets;  6° the intervention of the supervisory authority or of the federa l legisla-tive power to prevent the law from being violated or public interests from being harmed.  Supra -municipal collectivities are governed by the rule referred to in Arti-cle 134. This rule enshrines the application of the principles mentioned in the second paragraph. Other principles considered essential can be set by the rule referred to in Article 134, whether or not adopted by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, under the condition that the majority of the members of the Parliament concerne d is present. Articles 159 and 190 are applicable to decisions and regulations of supra -municipal collectivities.”  In accordance with a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, the federate law or the rule referred to in Articl e 134 estab-lishes the conditions and the manner in which several provinces, supra -mu-nicipal collectivities or municipalities can cooperate or form associations. However, provincial councils, councils of supra -municipal collectivities or municipal councils cannot be permitted to deliberate jointly.      69 Article 163   The competences exercised in the Flemish and Walloon Regions by elected provincial bodies are exercised, in the bilingual region of Brussels -Capital, by the Flemish and French Communities and by the  Joint Commu-nity Commission, each with respect to matters falling under their responsi-bility in pursuance of Articles 127 and 128 and, with respect to other matters, by the Brussels -Capital Region.  However, a law adopted by a majority as described in Arti cle 4, last para-graph establishes the detailed rules by which the Brussels -Capital Region or any institution whose members are designated by the latter exercise the competences described in the first paragraph which do not belong to those matters referred to in Article 39. A law adopted by the same majority lays down rules for the attribution to those institutions described in Article 136 of all or part of the competences referred to in the first paragraph that belong to those matters described in Articles 127 and 128.   Article 164   The drafting of registry office certificates relating to civil status and the maintenance of registers fall exclusively under the responsibility of the mu-nicipal authorities.   Article 165   § 1. The law creates metropolitan dis tricts and federations of municipali-ties. It determines their organisation and their competences and, when doing so, guarantees the application of the principles described in Article 162.  Each metropolitan district has a council and an executive college.  The president of the executive college is elected by the council from its midst; his election is ratified by the King; the law establishes his status.  Articles 159 and 190 apply to the decisions and regulations of the metro-politan districts and the federations of municipalities.  The boundaries of the metropolitan districts and of the federations of mu-nicipalities can only be changed or corrected by virt ue of a law.   § 2. The law creates the body within which each metropolitan district and  70 the nearest federations of municipalities consult each other under the con-ditions and in the manner which the law establishes to examine common problems of a technical  nature that fall under their respective competence.   § 3. Several federations of municipalities may cooperate or form associa-tions with each other or with one or more metropolitan districts in accord-ance with the conditions and in the manner prescribed b y the law to jointly regulate and manage those issues that fall within their competence.  Their councils are not permitted to deliberate jointly.   Article 166   § 1. Article 165 applies to the metropolitan district to which the capital of the Kingdom belongs, with the exception of what is provided for hereinafter.   § 2. The competences of the metropolitan district to which the capital of the Kingdom belongs are, in the manner determined by a law adopted by a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph, exercised by the bodies of the Brussels -Capital Region created by virtue of Article 39.   § 3. The bodies described in Article 136:  1° possess, each for its Community, the same competences as the other organising powers with respect to cultural, educational and person -related matters;  2° exercise, each for its Community, the competences delegated to them by the Flemish Community Parliame nt and by the French Com-munity Parliament;  3° jointly regulate those matters described in 1° which are of common interest.       71 TITLE IV   ON INTERNATI ONAL RELATI ONS   Article 167   § 1. The King directs international relations, notwithstanding the compe-tence of Communities and Regions to regulate international cooperation, in-cluding the concluding of treaties, for those matters that fall within their competences in pursuance of or by  virtue of the Constitution.  The King commands the armed forces; he states that there exists a state of war or that hostilities have ceased. He notifies the Houses with additional appropriate messages as soon as interests and security of the State permit.  Cession, exchange or expansion of territory can only take place by virtue of a law.    § 2. The King concludes treaties, with the exception of those regarding matters described in § 3.These treaties take effect only after they have re-ceived the approval of the House of Representatives.   § 3. The Community and Regional Governments described in Article 121 conclude, each one in so far as it is concerned, treaties regarding matters that fall within the competence of their Parliament.  These treaties take effect only after they have received the approval of the Parliament.   § 4. A law adopted by  a majority as described in Article 4, last paragraph fixes the specific rules for the concluding of treaties described in § 3 and of the treaties that do not exclusively concern matters falling within the com-petence of the Regions or Communities in pursua nce of or by virtue of the Constitution.   § 5. The King, by common consent with the Community or Regional Gov-ernments concerned, can denounce treaties concluded before 18 May 1993 and covering matters described in § 3.  The King denounces these treaties i f the Community or Regional Govern-ments concerned invite him to do so. A law adopted by a majority as de-scribed in Article 4, last paragraph establishes the procedure in the event of  72 disagreement between the Community and Regional Governments con-cerned.   Transitional provision   The second sentence of § 2 comes into force on the day when elections take place with a view to the complete renewal of the Community and Re-gional Parliaments in 2014. Until this day, treaties referred to in § 2 take effect only af ter they have received the approval of both Houses.

They receive the draft treaty before its signature.   Article 168 bis   With respect to the election of the European Parliament, the law deter-mines special rules with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of French and Dutch -speak ing people in the former province of Brabant.

The law can abolish, either totally or partially, the taxes referred to in the first sub -paragraph.   § 4. A charge or tax can only be introduced by the metropolitan districts, federations of municipalities or by the municipalities by a decision of th eir council.  The law determines, with respect to the taxes referred to in the first sub -paragraph, the exceptions that are proved to be necessary.
